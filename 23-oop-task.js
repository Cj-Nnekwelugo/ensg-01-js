/* 
You're building a simple system for a school.

Create a Person class with a constructor that takes name and age, and a method introduce() that logs:
 "Hi, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

Then create a Student class that inherits from Person. It should:
Accept name, age, and an additional grade property
Have its own method study() that logs: "[name] is studying for grade [grade]."
Still be able to use the introduce() method from Person
*/
